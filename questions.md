## The project
* What business problem are we trying to solve?

    &rarr; reduce choice paradox problem of the customer

    &rarr; makes the customer experience better and satisfy the need 

    &rarr; improve click rate (CTR)
    
    &rarr; improves sales/upselling
* What’s the end product we wish to deliver?

    &rarr; multi-objective recommender system

    &rarr; based on previous events in a user session
    
    &rarr; optimizes for clicks, add-to-carts and orders
* Are there similar projects / papers that have already done this that we can learn from before we get started?
    
    &rarr; add some links to notebooks/videos
* What are the risks?

    &rarr; bad recommendations

    &rarr; poor user experience

    &rarr; decrease in CRT and sales

* What are simple logical chronological milestones to see if what we are doing is working?

    &rarr; EDA

    &rarr; baseline model 

    &rarr; machine learning model

    &rarr; cross validation

    &rarr; comparison of different models (ensemble methods)

    &rarr; A/B testing

## The data
* Is our data source reliable, clean and consumable?
* What is the distribution and nature of the data?
* Where is our data stored? How is our model going to access it?
* How big is our data? Do we have enough computation power to handle the data and solve the problem?

## The model
* Given the distribution and nature of the data/problem, what models should we use?
* What is our baseline model?
* Is our black box model better than our baseline model?
* Which metric will we use to optimize our model?
* Can we interpret model insights and results back to business impact?
* Will our business stakeholders understand how our model works?
* How will we know we did the analysis and model correctly?
* What do we expect the result to be?

    &rarr; 

## The implementation
* What metric will we use to call this project a success and how will we measure it?
* What metrics will we watch to avoid risks?
* How often should we retrain the model?
* Can we automate all of our pipelines?
* What will the final infrastructure look like?

## Technical questions
* why did we use parquet? how does parquet work?
* why did we choose our model? how does it work?
* what would we do, if our model crashed? are we going to have a backup?‚
